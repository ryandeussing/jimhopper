    info: 'Published in June 2015, this brief essay explains basic brain responses to being attacked, including sexually. It also has links to key scientific review articles on the brain bases and evolutionary origins of commonly misunderstood effects of the fear circuitry taking over: impairment of the prefrontal cortex, survival reflexes (e.g., freezing, tonic immobility) and ineffective habit behaviors.'

    source: Time.com
    info: "This brief essay explains how fear and trauma, including in the midst of a sexual assault, shape how memories are encoded, and thus how we should expect the memories to be later, when the victim is trying to recall what happened with investigators, school administrators, family and friends. Understanding these basics can be very helpful to everyone involved, including by decreasing victims' shame and self-doubt about fragmentary and incomplete memories."

It includes the PowerPoint slides and embedded videos that illustrate key impacts (e.g., reflexive survival responses). This is what I present on the most and gets rave reviews from civilian and military police, attorneys and victim advocates, higher education administrators, etc."

<p class="editable">Why don't many people fight or yell when they're being raped?<br /><br />Why are memories of sexual assault so often fragmentary and confusing?</p>

<p class="editable">Is the brain&rsquo;s response to attack essentially the same &ndash; controlled by the circuitry of fear, running on reflexes and habits &ndash; during sexual assault, physical assault, and military combat?<br /><br />What are the implications of the answers to those questions &ndash; for people who've been sexually assaulted, for those who investigate and prosecute such crimes, and for everyone else who encounters or knows someone who's been sexually assaulted?</p>

<p class="editable">These are questions I spend a lot of time answering these days as a consultant and trainer.<br /><br />And I provide answers here, with links to my writings in the popular media, videos of me training and answering questions about sexual assault, and handouts with guidance for police officers, victim advocates and others who interview and work with people who have been sexually assaulted.</p>
