    info: "This brief essay explains how fear and trauma, including in the midst of a sexual assault, shape how memories are encoded, and thus how we should expect the memories to be later, when the victim is trying to recall what happened with investigators, school administrators, family and friends. Understanding these basics can be very helpful to everyone involved, including by decreasing victims' shame and self-doubt about fragmentary and incomplete memories."

<h2>Sexual Assault</h2>

<p class="editable">Sexual assault is an area where I am currently focusing a lot of my work &ndash; including presentations, writings, trainings, consultations and expert testimony (see <a href="/services/">Professional Services</a>).</p>

<p class="editable">The two topics on which I most commonly teach are "the neurobiology of trauma and sexual assault" and the experiences and needs of males who have been sexually assaulted.</p>

<p class="editable">For now, this section mostly links to my writings in the popular media and videos of me training and answering questions about sexual assault.</p>
