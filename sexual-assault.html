<h1>Sexual Assault</h1>
<p>Sexual assault is an area where I am currently focusing a lot of my work â€“ including presentations, trainings, writings, consultations and expert testimony.
</p>
<p>The two topics on which I most commonly teach are "the neurobiology of trauma and sexual assault" and the experiences and needs of males who have been sexually assaulted.
</p>
<p>For now, this section mostly links to my writings in the popular media and videos of me training and answering questions about sexual assault.
</p>
<p><span class="s2"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/">Why Many Rape Victims Don't Fight or Yell</a></span> - Published by the Washington Post on June 23, 2015, this 1000-word essay explains basic brain responses to being attacked, including sexually. It also has links to key scientific review articles on brain-based and evolution-shaped survival reflexes (e.g., freezing, tonic immobility), on stress- and fear-induced impairment of the prefrontal cortex, and how stress- and fear-induced reliance on habit behaviors.

<p><span class="s2"><a href="http://time.com/3625414/rape-trauma-brain-memory/">Why Rape and Trauma Victims Have Fragmented and Incomplete Memories</a></span> - Published by Time.com, this under-1000-word essay explains how fear and trauma, including in the midst of a sexual assault, shape how memories are encoded, and thus how we should expect memories the memories to be later, when the victim is trying to recall what happened with the investigators, school administrators, family and friends. Understanding these basics can greatly improve the understanding of everyone involved, and can decrease victims shame and self-doubt about their often fragmentary and incomplete memories.

<p>Repeat Rape by College Men: The Statistics and Science [link] - This page presents, in simple terms with links to scientific research, statistics on repeat rape among college men. It explains why this is the best summary of the findings to date: A<i>bout two-thirds of college rapists are repeat offenders who account for the great majority of rapes (over 90%).</i>
</p>
<p><span class="s2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwTQ_U3p5Wc">Neurobiology of Trauma &amp; Sexual Assault</a></span> - Just under 2-hour YouTube video of me presenting on this topic, complete with PowerPoint slides and embedded videos (e.g., to illustrate reflexive survival responses). This is what I present on the most and gets rave reviews from civilian and military police, attorneys, victim advocates, etc.
</p>
<p><span class="s2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZk6aLBZFyA">Neurobiology of Trauma &amp; Sexual Assault: Key Points for Investigators</a></span> - Video of me answering questions about commonly misunderstood or overlooked brain-based responses during sexual assault, and their implications for investigators.
</p>
<p><span class="s2"><a href="http://www.jimhopper.com/pdfs/Handout_for_Victim_Advocates.pdf">Handout for Victim Advocates</a></span> - Ways to answers sexual assault victims' common questions with brain-based explanations, which can increase their understanding and greatly reduce their shame and self-blame. Before using this handout, watch my "Neurogiology of Trauma and Sexual Assault" YouTube video (see above).
