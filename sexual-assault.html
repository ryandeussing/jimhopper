    info: 'Published in June 2015, this brief essay explains basic brain responses to being attacked, including sexually.

    info: "This brief essay explains how fear and trauma, including in the midst of a sexual assault, shape how memories are encoded, and thus how we should expect the memories to be later, when the victim is trying to recall what happened with investigators, school administrators, family and friends. Understanding these basics can be very helpful to everyone involved, including by decreasing victims' shame and self-doubt about fragmentary and incomplete memories."
