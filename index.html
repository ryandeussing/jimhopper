        <p>I am a clinical psychologist, independent consultant, Teaching Associate in the Department of Psychiatry of Harvard Medical School, and nationally recognized expert on psychological trauma, especially child abuse and sexual assault.</p>
        <p>My research, clinical work, teaching and consultation have focused on the psychological and biological effects of child abuse and sexual assault, and on contemplative practices for healing, including meditation.</p>
        <p>I consult to a variety of clients and and teach a variety of professionals on trauma, healing and seeking justice, including the neurobiology of trauma and its implications for the law enforcement and criminal justice systems, the unique impacts of sexual trauma on boys and men, and contemplative methods in the healing of trauma.</p>
        <p>I regularly advise and train civilian and military investigators and prosecutors, victim advocates, judges, university administrators and senior officers of the United States military services and Department of Defense. My nonprofit and policy work have included being a founding board member and long-time advisor of 1in6, and serving on the Peace Corps Sexual Assault Advisory Council.</p>
        <p>Finally, as you will see on this website, I like to share my knowledge and insights, as much as possible, for free.</p>
