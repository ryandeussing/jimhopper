This section covers some key topics related to healing and happiness, which we all want and deserve to have in our lives.

For now this section is oriented to those seeking healing from the effects of unwanted or abusive experiences in childhood or the effects of sexual assault. However, much of the information here applies to all of us, and will be helpful to a variety of readers.
