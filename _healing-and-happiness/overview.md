## Healing and Happiness

This section of my site covers some key topics related to healing and happiness, which we all want and deserve to have in our lives.

More pages may be added in the future, but for now this section is focused on resources for those seeking healing from the effects of unwanted or abusive experiences in childhood or sexual assault.

[Can we somehow "panel" the pages of this section below this brief intro text?]
