This page has most of my publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. It also has a recently released book that I co-edited with colleagues, and chapters from the book that I wrote and co-wrote. The academic articles and book chapters can be downloaded as PDFs.

For papers where I appear first in the author list, I took the lead and wrote all or most of the paper. In most cases where I'm first author, I designed the study, supervised its implementation (e.g., participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, etc.), and interpreted the findings. However, science is always a team effort, and in <u>every</u> case my co-authors played important roles too.

Papers where colleagues are the first authors were chosen (from a larger number) because I helped to design the studies and/or interpret the findings, not just write the paper, and because I believe the topics and findings are important.

## Brain Imaging Studies of PTSD

<div class="item">
<p class="title">Neural correlates of reexperiencing, avoidance, and dissociation in PTSD: Symptom dimensions and emotion dysregulation in responses to script-driven trauma imagery. </p>
<p class="authors">Hopper JW, Frewen PA, van der Kolk BA, Lanius RA.</p>
<p class="details">J Trauma Stress 2007; ;22:713-725</p>

<p>This paper's introduction and discussion sections address the complexity of subjective and brain processes involved in responses to trauma reminders. Thus they may be interesting and useful to people trying to understand the biological dimensions of PTSD and child abuse effects.<p></div>

<p class="title">Individual differences in a husband and wife who developed PTSD after a motor vehicle accident: A functional MRI case study. </p>
<p class="authors">Lanius RA, Hopper JW, Menon RS. </p>
<p class="details">Am J Psychiat 2003; 160:667-669</p>
<p>This short paper demonstrates that people can have very different responses, including brain responses, to the same traumatic event. The findings also suggest that the <em>functional significance</em> of a response, rather than any particular diagnosis the person can be given, is the key to understanding the brain processes involved.<p></div>

<p class="title">Recall of emotional states in posttraumatic stress disorder: An fMRI investigation </p>
<p class="authors">Lanius RA, Williamson PC, Hopper JW, Boksman K, Densmore M, Gupta MA, Neufeld RWJ, Gati JS, Menon R. </p>
<p class="details">Biol Psychiatry 2003; 53:204-210</p>
<p>The findings reported here suggests a major limitation of biological models of PTSD that focus exclusively on fear and leave out the full range of human emotional experiences and processes that may be altered.<p></div>

<p class="title"><a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1348751">Reexperiencing/hyperaroused and dissociative states in posttraumatic stress disorder: Functional brain imaging research â€“ and clinical implications</a></p>
<p class="authors">Lanius RA, Hopper JW (2008). </p>
<p class="details">Psychiatric Times, Vol. 25, No. 13</p>
<p>This brief overview paper for psychiatrists and other clinicians was "invited" by editors of <em>Psychiatric Times,</em> but not peer reviewed. It includes suggested resources for working with clients who suffer from PTSD and dissociation.<p></div>


## Responses to Script-Driven Imagery Scale (RSDI)

<div class="item">
<p class="title">The Responses to Script-Driven Imagery Scale (RSDI): Assessment of state posttraumatic symptoms for psychobiological and treatment research</p>
<p class="authors">Hopper JW, Frewen PA, Sack M, Lanius RA, van der Kolk BA. </p>
<p class="details">J Psychopathol Behav Assess 2007; 20:713-725</p>
<p>This paper introduces a scale that I developed primarily for research applications. However, parts of the introduction and discussion may be interesting and useful to non-researchers too, because they address the complexity of responses to strong trauma reminders in PTSD, and the limitations of traditional (structured interview) methods for assessing the effectiveness of treatments for PTSD.<p></div>


## 'Reward Function' in in PTSD

<div class="item">
<p class="title">Probing reward function in posttraumatic stress disorder: Expectancy and satisfaction with monetary gains and losses </p>
<p class="authors">Hopper JW, Pitman RK,... Elman IE. </p>
<p class="details">J Psychiatry Res 2008; 42:802-807</p>
<p>This study (like other work by my colleague Igor Elman) suggests that PTSD can involve impairment of the brain's "reward circuitry." This circuitry underlies our capacities to want, expect, seek and enjoy potentially rewarding experiences. Impairments of this circuitry's functioning may partly account for "emotional numbing" and depression symptoms of traumatized people.<p></div>

A note on what "peer-reviewed" means: A manuscript was submitted to the editors of a specific journal, who then sent it to anonymous reviewers, who, along with the editors, provided feedback and suggestions (or demands) for specific changes. Those requested changes were incorporated into the final published version or otherwise addressed, e.g., shown by the authors, to the editors' satisfaction, to be unwarranted or otherwise unnecessary). This peer review process ensures "quality control" in the scientific enterprise, although it can also hinder or prevent the publication of ideas and findings that challenge the conventional wisdom.
