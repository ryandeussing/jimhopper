<h1>Information for Boys &amp; Men</h1>
<p>This section has lots of information and insights for and about boys and men who've had harmful unwanted or abusive childhood experiences.
</p>
<p>There's a lot of focus on unwanted or abusive <em>sexual</em> experiences, because such experiences and their effects tend to be especially sensitive and challenging for males – and still tend to be ignored and neglected in cultures around the world. That's also an area where I've got some expertise.
</p>
<p>Men who've experienced harmful harsh or abusive emotional and physical experiences as boys struggle with many of the same things as men who had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences as boys, including many of the same myths.
</p>
<p>Males aren't supposed to be victims – in any way – and aren't supposed to be emotionally harmed by whatever traumas they've gone through.
</p>
<p>Also, being a male can make it hard to heal from the effects of any kind of harmful treatment or abuse.
</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, what's in this section can be helpful to many men, whatever traumatic or very difficult experiences they may have had while growing up.
</p>
<p>If you are seeking resources specifically for men who experienced unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood, I also highly recommend <a href="https://www.1in6.org/">1in6.org</a>. I was a founding board member of 1in6 and wrote most of what's on their comprehensive website (some of which is included here).
