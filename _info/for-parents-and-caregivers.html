<h2>Information for Parents &amp; Caregivers
</h2>
<p>If your child has been abused or may have been abused, I'm so sorry that you're going through this and hope you get all of the information and support that you and your child need.
</p>
<p>Here I provide some basic resources for parents and caregivers â€“ not only those of you with children who have experienced abuse, but all parents and caregivers, including those who themselves had harmful unwanted or abusive experiences as children.
</p>
<p>The effects of child abuse can be increased or decreased by key relationships in the child's life. More than anyone else (including therapists), parents and caregivers can help children recover from abuse and its effects.
</p>
<p>If you want immediate information, including on how to find professional help for a child or adolescent, see the National Child Traumatic Stress Network's <a href="http://www.nctsnet.org/nccts/nav.do?pid=ctr_aud_prnt_gethelp">How to Find Help</a> page, and especially their <a href="http://www.nctsnet.org/nccts/nav.do?pid=abt_ntwk">Network Members</a> page, which lists centers and clinics all around the US, each of which will know of excellent resources in their area.
</p>
<p>Although I am a parent myself, working professionally with children and parents is not my specialty. (I work with adults who were abused as children.) So I've consulted with trusted colleagues who have specialized training and years of experience working with abused children and their caregivers. Below are their recommendations.
</p>
<p>First, here are two relatively brief and free resources on the web:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jimhopper.com/pdfs/ChildrenAndTrauma.pdf">Children and Trauma</a>, a handout by Drs. Margaret Blaustein and Kristine Kinniburgh, authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1606236253/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20">Treating Traumatic Stress in Children and Adolescents</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://childtrauma.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Helping_Traumatized_Children_Caregivers_Perry1.pdf">Helping Traumatized Children: A Brief Overview for Caregivers</a>, by Dr. Bruce Perry, Director of the <a href="http://www.childtrauma.org/">ChildTrauma Academy</a></li>

<h2>Appropriate vs. Concerning Sexual Behavior in Children</h2>
<p>This is a question that many parents find themselves confronting at some point, if not concerning their own children then their children's friends and playmates.
</p>
<p>I highly recommend the booklet <a href="http://www.tcavjohn.com/products.php#Fundamentals">Understanding children's sexual behaviors: What's natural and healthy</a>. It's by Dr. Toni Cavanagh Johnson, an internationally respected expert, only 26 pages long, written in simple language for all parents (educators, etc.), and cheap ($2.50). You can order it there.
</p>
<p>See also, <a href="http://www.stopitnow.org/guidebooks#DoChildrenAbuse">Do Children Sexually Abuse Other Children</a>, a free online 'guidebook' published by <a href="http://www.stopitnow.org/">Stop It Now</a>.
</p>

<h2>Books on Preventing Child Sexual Abuse</h2>
<p>Here are books that parents can read and discuss with their 4 to 8 year old children:

<h2>Child with Sexual Behavior Problems</h2>
<p>If you are the parent or caregiver of a child or teen with sexual behavior problems, from 1998 through 2007 <a href="http://www.stopitnow.org/">Stop It Now</a> published an excellent newsletter, <a href="http://www.stopitnow.org/help-guidance/resources/stop-it-now-publications/parenttalk-archives">PARENTtalk</a>, written by and for parents of children and teens with sexual behavior problems. During its years of publication, the newsletter offered parents the opportunity "to break the isolation surrounding this issue and offer support to each other through personal stories." It remains a valuable resource, and all issues are free in the <a href="http://www.stopitnow.org/help-guidance/resources/stop-it-now-publications/parenttalk-archives">online archive</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.safersociety.org/">The Safer Society Foundation</a> has resources for parents of children with sexual behavior problems, including a <a href="http://www.safersociety.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&amp;category=0040&amp;sortorder=descending">selection of books</a> in their online store, and the <a href="http://www.atsa.com/">Association for the Treatment of Sex Abusers (ATSA)</a> has an online fact sheet on <a href="http://www.atsa.com/children-sexual-behavior-problems">Children with Sexual Behavior Problems</a>.
