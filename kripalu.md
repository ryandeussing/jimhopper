## About Our 5-day Program

### From the Kripalu catalog and website:

For therapists, yoga instructors, researchers, and everyone interested in harnessing the brain for transformation. This program is an “intensive format” workshop including more learning hours than the average 5-day course.

Learn how Buddhist- and neuroscience-informed meditation and yoga techniques can cultivate mindful embodiment and transform habitual thoughts, emotions, and behaviors into openings for freedom, love, and happiness.

Drawing on contemporary neuroscience and traditional Buddhist psychology, this workshop focuses on seven key dimensions of human experience and their corresponding brain circuitries: aversion, seeking, satisfaction, bodily awareness, executive functioning, relationships, and “default mode” processes. Jim Hopper and David Schouela interweave theory with practice to promote an experiential understanding of these concepts.

Explore Buddhist practices, including concentration, mindfulness, loving-kindness, and mind-training meditations, and contemporary yoga practices that can harness and transform our brain circuitries and the relationships between them. Jim and Dana provide handouts for every presentation and step-by-step instructions for each practice.
