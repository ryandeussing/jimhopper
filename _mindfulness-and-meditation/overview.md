I have studied and practiced meditation for 30 years, and my ongoing efforts to cultivate concentration, mindfulness, insight, kindness, compassion and love have greatly benefited my personal and professional lives and relationships.

I created this section of my website to share some of what I've learned, with anyone who might find these perspectives and resources helpful.

Most of the information provided here is about mindfulness and how to cultivate it, but just as important is the page on kindness and compassion, which are essential companions to mindfulness â€“ and keys to living with freedom and genuine happiness.
