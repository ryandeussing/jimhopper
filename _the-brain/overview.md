Here I introduce my central teachings on the human brain. As you will see, they revolve around some key brain circuitries and their roles in fundamental cycles of suffering, healing and happiness.

These teachings are grounded in decades of study and practice as a researcher, therapist, consultant and teacher – and in my personal life as a family member, friend, and long-term practitioner of contemplative practices, including various forms of meditation.

I have two main goals for this section of my site on the brain.

One is to provide knowledge and insights about the brain – your brain – that make sense to you and that help you make sense of your experiences, thoughts, emotions, values and behaviors.

Another is to provide, in combination with other parts of this site, some guidance for healing suffering and bringing more genuine happiness into our lives.

## Some Cautions

The human brain is incredibly complex, with about 100 billion neurons (or brain cells). Neuroscience research is also vast in its breadth and depth.

As a psychologist who has studied neuroscience for more than 25 years, and conducted brain imaging studies on traumatized people, I appreciate that complexity and that vastness. I've learned some important things about studying and teaching about the brain:

* Even the greatest neuroscientists must pick and choose where they focus their own research and what they learn about others' research.
* All who study the brain must simplify things, not only to teach others but to make sense of the brain for themselves.
* The best researchers and teachers, who possess both great knowledge and integrity, strive to ensure that their simplifications are consistent with the science and not contradicted by any of it.
* Because brain-based explanations are over-valued these days, many people are making claims about the brain – including grand and sweeping ones – that are confused and misleading, even false.


## My Guiding Principles

In my research, studies and teaching on the brain, I have a few guiding principles:

1. I focus on brain circuitries and brain-based processes that people can (a) easily connect to their own experience and (b) choose to notice, reflect upon, and change. (By "circuitry" I mean a collection of brain areas that work together to perform certain functions.) There are many aspects of the brain and its functioning that have huge impacts on us and are affected by our choices and behaviors, but are not available to conscious awareness (e.g., amounts of a particular brain chemical, densities of a receptor type). Drug companies and some governments spend lots of money studying and trying to change such things, sometimes with very positive effects. In contrast, I focus on things that we can experience directly and can change – for better or worse – with our own individual attention, values, thoughts, choices and behaviors.
2. I strive to ensure that my concepts and models are consistent with and not contradicted by the latest relevant neuroscience research.
3. I do not focus on how traumatic or other harmful experiences, or self-destructive behaviors including addictions, can "damage" the brain. The human brain's resilience and capacities for changing and healing are huge, and influenced by many different factors. Given how people tend to believe what (apparent) experts say about the brain, there is a risk that such statements about "brain damage" (even if true) can have big unhelpful effects on how people see their prospects for healing and finding happiness.


I hope you find these teachings and resources useful.
