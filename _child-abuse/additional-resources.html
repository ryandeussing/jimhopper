<h2 class="headline">Additional Resources on Child Abuse</h2>
<p>This section consists primarily of links to websites, but I also suggest three hotlines, a referral service that can help you find a therapist in your area, some books and an article on the international prevalence of child sexual abuse. (For resources specifically for parents and caregivers of abused children, see Parents &amp; Caregivers [link].)
</p>
<p>If you are looking for a therapist or counselor in the United States, even if only for a couple of consultations, the Sidran Foundation has an extensive list of therapists and clinics around the country that specialize in treating people with histories of severe child abuse. See <a href="https://www.sidran.org/help-desk/" target="_blank">Help Desk</a>.
</p>
<p>If you need <u>immediate</u> information about and/or connection to resources in your own community, here are four 24-hour toll-free hotlines that you can call, three in the US and one in the UK:
</p>

<p><span class="help">Childhelp USA's National Child Abuse Hotline</span><br>
1-800-422-4453</p>
<p>Childhelp USA is a non-profit organization "dedicated to meeting the physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual needs of abused and neglected children." Its programs and services include this hotline, which children can call with complete anonymity and confidentiality.

From the site: "The Childhelp USA® National Child Abuse Hotline is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Don't be afraid to call. No one is silly or unimportant to us. If something is bothering you or you want information, CALL!"
</p>
<p><span class="help">Rape Abuse &amp; Incest National Network</span><br>
1-800-656-4673 (HOPE)
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rainn.org/" target="_blank">RAINN</a> RAINN has a 24-hour National Sexual Assault Hotline and a <a href="http://www.rainn.org/get-help/national-sexual-assault-online-hotline" target="_blank">National Sexual Assault <em>Online</em> Hotline</a> (chat) staffed with trained volunteers and paid staff members who also have knowledge of sexual abuse issues and services. <em>All calls are confidential, and callers may remain anonymous if they wish.</em>
</p>
<p><span class="help">National Domestic Violence/Abuse Hotline</span><br>
1-800-799-SAFE<br>
1-800-799-7233
1-800-787-3224 TDD
</p>
<p>This is a 24-hour-a-day hotline, staffed by trained volunteers who are ready to connect people with emergency help in their own communities, including emergency services and shelters. The staff can also provide information and referrals for a variety of non-emergency services, including counseling for adults and children, and assistance in reporting abuse. They have an extensive database of domestic violence treatment providers in all US states and territories. Many staff members speak languages besides English, and they have 24-hour access to translators for approximately 150 languages. For the hearing impaired, there is a TDD number. This is a good resource for people who are experiencing or have experienced domestic violence or abuse, or who suspect that someone they know is being abused (though it is not perfect, and may not have the best number in your area). <em>All calls to the hotline are confidential, and callers may remain anonymous if they wish.</em>

<h2>In terms of books, these are my top recommendations:</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1555426743/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20" target="_blank">How Long Does It Hurt? A Guide to Recovering from Incest and Sexual Abuse for Teenagers, Their friends, and Their Families</a>, by Cynthia Mather, Kristina Debye, Judy Wood, and Eliana Gill.This book was written by an incest survivor, and provides step-by-step guidance for sexually abused teenagers. It has a great deal of knowledge and resources to help teenagers understand what they are going through and overcome feelings of isolation, confusion, and self-doubt to truly heal.</p>

<p>
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1572242795/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20" target="_blank">It Happened to Me: A Teen's Guide to Overcoming Sexual Abuse</a></em>, by William Lee Carter.This workbook is written for teenagers, and has effective exercises help them learn about the different aspects of trauma, clarify their own ideas and beliefs, and explore new ways of feeling and relating. The author is a psychologist who works with sexually abused teens on a daily basis. His approach is very positive. The exercises focus on gaining the strength and confidence needed to reshape one's self-image, connect with others in healthy ways, and develop the skills needed to realize one's full potential.</p>

<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1886968098/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20" target="_blank">Growing Beyond Survival: A Self-Help Toolkit for Managing Traumatic Stress</a></em>, by Elizabeth Vermilyea.If you want to start learning and practicing the self-regulation skills essential to recovering from the effects of child abuse, or to build on progress you are already making, particularly if you struggle with dissociation, I recommend this book. To learn more about the book and/or order it directly from the publisher (for a higher price than Amazon), go to the <a href="http://www.sidran.org/shop/books/growing-beyond-survival-a-self-help-toolkit-for-managing-traumatic-stress-second-edition/" target="_blank">Growing Beyond Survival</a> page of the Sidran Press catalog.</p>

<p>
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465087302/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20" target="_blank">Trauma and Recovery</a></em>, by Judith L. Herman.I still believe this is the best book on psychological trauma and recovery, particularly extreme child abuse. Herman integrates a great deal of research with decades of clinical wisdom and some thought-provoking historical and political perspectives. <em>Trauma and Recovery</em> is appropriate for survivors of child abuse and other interpersonal traumas, as well as clinicians and the general reader.I especially recommend this book to students and others just beginning to learn about child abuse and how people recover from these experiences. Though a lot has been learned since Herman wrote this book (e.g., the widely available treatment <a href="http://www.emdr.com/" target="_blank">EMDR</a> has been proven to be an effective and efficient treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder), this book has easily stood the test of time.You can learn more about the book (critical acclaim, contents, brief excerpts) from my Web page: <a href="http://www.jimhopper.com/trauma_and_recovery" target="_blank"><em>Trauma and Recovery</em> - Judith Herman's Landmark Book on Child Abuse &amp; Other Traumas</a>.
