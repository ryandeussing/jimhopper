<h2>Media Coverage of Recovered Memories</h2>
<p>This short page provides links to an article, a commentary, and a presentation that are very informative and clarifying.
</p>
<p>The first article, published by Mike Stanton in the 1997 <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>, traces the stark reversal in the major media's portrayal of recovered memories of sexual abuse, which corresponded to the rise of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation and its (ongoing) aggressive public relations efforts.
</p>
<p>The second, a February 2003 online commentary by cognitive psychologist Jennifer Freyd, lucidly demonstrates how the media continues to give the public biased, incomplete and deceptive accounts of research by those who claim it is easy to implant false memories of sexual abuse and that recovered memories are likely false.
</p>
<p>Finally, Dr. Freyd's 2004 presentation addresses these same issues and presents research on the effects of such media coverage.
